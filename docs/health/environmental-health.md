# Environmental Health: Underexplored but Evidence-Rich

Three areas with solid epidemiological data that rarely make it into public health discourse.

---

## 1. Noise Pollution → Cardiovascular Outcomes

**The evidence:**
- Chronic noise exposure (especially night-time) linked to hypertension, heart disease, stroke
- WHO estimates Western Europeans lose 1+ million healthy life years annually to traffic noise alone
- Mechanisms: stress hormones, sleep fragmentation, sustained elevated heart rate

**Key studies:**
- Aircraft noise near airports → increased cardiovascular mortality
- Road traffic noise → dose-response relationship with heart attack risk
- Night-time noise more damaging than daytime (disrupts recovery)

**The gap:**
We regulate air quality but largely ignore noise. Decibel limits exist but enforcement is weak. Urban planning rarely considers acoustic health.

## 2. Light Pollution → Circadian Disruption → Metabolic Effects

**The evidence:**
- Artificial light at night suppresses melatonin, shifts circadian rhythm
- Linked to obesity, diabetes, depression, some cancers (breast cancer in shift workers)
- Even dim light during sleep affects glucose metabolism

**Key findings:**
- Shift workers have elevated metabolic syndrome risk
- Outdoor light pollution correlates with obesity rates at population level
- Blue light particularly disruptive (screens, LEDs)

**The gap:**
Sleep hygiene advice focuses on personal behavior, but environmental light pollution is systemic. Street lighting, signage, building lights - no one's responsible for the aggregate effect.

## 3. Air Quality → Cognitive Performance

**The evidence:**
- PM2.5 and NO2 exposure linked to cognitive decline, dementia risk
- Acute effects too: high pollution days → worse test scores, more errors
- Children in high-pollution areas show developmental impacts

**Surprisingly strong data:**
- Chess players make more mistakes on high pollution days
- Stock traders perform worse
- Students in ventilated vs unventilated classrooms show measurable differences
- Indoor CO2 levels in offices affect decision-making quality

**The gap:**
Air quality discussed as respiratory/cancer issue. Cognitive effects are less visible but arguably more economically significant. We're all slightly dumber on bad air days.

## Common Thread

These are all:
- **Chronic, low-grade exposures** - not acute poisoning, so less visible
- **Systemic/environmental** - can't fully opt out through personal choice
- **Cross-cutting** - affect cardiovascular, metabolic, cognitive systems simultaneously
- **Inequitably distributed** - poor neighborhoods get more of all three

Yet they're barely in public health conversation compared to diet, exercise, smoking.
