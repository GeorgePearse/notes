# UK Prison Industry Research

## Prison Population & Incarceration Rate

- **Total UK prison population**: ~97,700 (March 2024)
  - England & Wales: 87,900 (hit record 88,889 in Oct 2024)
  - Scotland: 8,000
  - Northern Ireland: 1,900

- **Incarceration rate**: [Highest in Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_prison_population)
  - England & Wales: 134-159 per 100,000
  - Scotland: 162 per 100,000
  - For comparison: US is ~531 per 100,000

- **Crisis**: System at 99.2% capacity, 60% of prisons overcrowded. Emergency early releases of 5,000+ prisoners to manage.

## Private Prisons in the UK

**Scale**: [~15-18% of prisoners](https://www.politics.co.uk/reference/private-prisons/) held in private facilities - **higher proportion than the US** (~8%) and second only to Australia globally.

**The Big Three Companies**:

| Company | Prisons | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Sodexo** (France) | 6 | Food services company |
| **Serco** (UK) | 5 | Also runs immigration detention |
| **G4S** (UK) | 4 | Now owned by Allied Universal |

14 private prisons total in England & Wales out of 117.

## Prison Labor in the UK

**Key difference from US**: Prison labor is [paid but at extreme sub-minimum wage rates](https://iwoc.iww.org.uk/prison-labour/).

**Pay Structure** ([set in 2002, never increased](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/research/projects/feminist-recovery-plan/teaching/policy-briefs/prison_labourin_the_uk_-_rebecca_cole_et_al.pdf)):

- **Minimum**: £4/week
- **Typical range**: £7.50-£23.50/week
- **Unable to work** (sick/elderly): £2.50-£3.25/week
- **Day release exception**: Must pay National Minimum Wage

This works out to **1-2 hours at minimum wage for a full week's work**.

**Legal Framework**:

- [National Minimum Wage Act 1998](https://uklabourlawblog.com/2022/12/12/pay-for-work-in-prison-by-virginia-mantouvalou/) explicitly **excludes prisoners**
- Prison Rules 1999: Up to 10 hours/day of "useful work" can be required
- Refusal to work = loss of privileges (visits, association time) via IEP scheme

## Major Scandals & Failures

### Electronic Tagging Fraud (2013)

- G4S and Serco [charged for tagging people who were dead, in prison, or abroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serco)
- G4S fined £38.5m, Serco fined £19.2m
- Judge: Serco engaged in "quite deliberate fraud"
- Yet the MOJ gave them [new £500m contracts in 2024](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/05/01/ministry-of-justice-serco-g4s-sfo/)

### HMP Birmingham (G4S)

- Prisoner died from synthetic drug (spice); drugs so prevalent [inspectors felt the effects](https://weownit.org.uk/blog/shocking-reality-g4s-management-prisons)
- 2018 riot requiring 380 prisoner transfers
- G4S admitted breach of Article 2 (right to life) systemic duty
- Government terminated contract, brought prison into public ownership (2019)

### Other Incidents

- **2012 Olympics**: G4S failed to provide security, army had to step in
- **Immigration Detention**: Abuse allegations at Yarl's Wood (Serco) - branded "place of national concern"

## Political Connections & Lobbying

**Early History**: [UK Detention Services Ltd](https://hir.harvard.edu/us-uk-prison-privatization/) (joint venture with CCA) formed 1987 with companies that were "regular contributors to the Conservative Party." Company admitted spending "two or three years" convincing government to privatize.

**Industry Structure**: Private companies "linked very close to the Conservative Party and to ex-civil servants, ex top cops and ex army chiefs"

**Public Opinion**: [49% oppose private prisons, only 37% comfortable](https://www.politics.co.uk/reference/private-prisons/)

## UK vs US Comparison

| Aspect | UK | US |
|--------|----|----|
| % in private prisons | ~18% | ~8% |
| Prison labor pay | £4-25/week | 7 states: $0; others: $0.14-$2/hr |
| Main issue | Corporate fraud/incompetence | 13th Amendment forced labor |
| Political ties | Conservative Party | Both parties, but especially GOP |
| Reform movement | Howard League, Abolitionist Futures | ACLU, Sentencing Project |

## Key Takeaway

The UK has a *higher* proportion of prisoners in private facilities than the US, but the "forced labor" issue is less severe because prisoners are (nominally) paid. However, the £4/week minimum hasn't been raised since 2002, making it exploitative in practice. The major UK scandal pattern is around corporate fraud and deadly incompetence, while these same companies keep winning government contracts.
